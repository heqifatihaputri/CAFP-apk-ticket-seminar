# CAFP-apk-ticket-seminar

I developed this application as part of my Bachelor's thesis (Final Project) in Information Systems.
It manages seminar and ticket purchases.
There are two actors in this app: Admin and User.
The admin can manage seminar data and ticket sales, while the user can purchase tickets and mark their attendance within the application.
